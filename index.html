  <p><strong>Projeto Quipá</strong> is a social startup that <strong>helps people take care of the Brazilian Caatinga and their communities</strong>. We currently work in the Serra da Capivara Territory, Piauí, Brazil.</p>
  <h2>Caatinga</h2>
  <p>The Caatinga is one of the largest ecoregions of the seasonally dry tropical forest biome and it has a unique and biodiverse flora and fauna adapted to semiarid climate conditions:</P>
  <ul>
    <li>&gt;3150 plants species (23% endemic)</li>
    <li>548 bird species</li>
    <li>183 mammal species</li>
    <li>98 amphibian and 79 lizard species</li>
    <li>187 bee species</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>The Caatinga is also known for the <strong>sertanejo</strong>, a hardy and joyful people that live in this semi-arid back-country, the <strong>sertão</strong>.</p>
  
  <p>As with many dry tropical forests across the world the Caatinga is forgotten, under-protected and under-researched with <strong>only about 7% protection (1% strict protection, 6% sustainable use).</strong></p>
  
  <p>Over half of the Caatinga suffers from <strong>deforestation, degradation and desertification</strong> mainly caused by threats such as <strong>unsustainable agriculture, mining, bush fires and large infrastructure projects.</strong></p>
